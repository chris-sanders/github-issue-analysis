Think very carefully about this task planning request. I need you to:

1. **Analyze the current codebase architecture** by reading:
   - docs/architecture.md
   - docs/data-schemas.md  
   - docs/api-reference.md
   - CLAUDE.md for development patterns
   - Recent task files to understand scope and patterns

2. **Consider the task requirements critically**:
   - Break down the functionality into specific components
   - Identify dependencies and integration points
   - Consider edge cases and error handling
   - Think about testing requirements
   - Evaluate impact on existing systems

3. **Ask clarifying questions** if any of these are unclear:
   - Specific functionality details
   - User interface requirements
   - Data models and validation needs
   - Integration requirements
   - Performance or scalability concerns
   - Authentication/authorization needs

4. **Create a comprehensive task file** using the template structure with:
   - Clear, specific acceptance criteria
   - Detailed implementation notes
   - Validation steps with specific commands
   - Dependencies and architectural considerations

Do NOT start implementing code - this is planning only. Focus on understanding requirements thoroughly and creating a roadmap for implementation.
